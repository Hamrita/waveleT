<p>
Here <b>Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transforms</b> (MODWTs) are computed with the 'modwt' function of the <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavelets/wavelets.pdf' target="_blank"> R package 'wavelets'</a>.
<br>
<p>
<b>Multi-Resolution Analysis</b> based on MODWT is carried out and <b>smooths</b> and <b>details</b> at each scale level can be displayed. The following figure is a reminder of how the algorithm produces smooths (<i>S<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>S<sub>2</sub></i>,<i>S<sub>3</sub></i>, ...) and details (<i>D<sub>1</sub></i>,<i>D<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>D<sub>3</sub></i>, ...) in what is called the <b>pyramid algorithm</b>.
