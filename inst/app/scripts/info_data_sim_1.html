<h3>
General principle:
</h3>
<p>
You can generate your own signal (y<sub>1</sub>) as a sum of up to 3 sub-signals (y<sub>1,a</sub>, y<sub>1,b</sub>, and y<sub>1,c</sub>). You can generate a second signal (y<sub>2</sub>) in the same way.
</p>
<p>
You can also add some noise (\(E_1\) and \(E_2\)) to these sub-signals.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y_1=y_{1,a}+y_{1,b}+y_{1,c} + E_1\)</li>
  <li>\(y_2=y_{2,a}+y_{2,b}+y_{2,c} + E_2\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Noise characteristics:
</h3>

<p>
First you have to set the length <i>n</i> of your x-signals and y-signal(s). 
You can generate some noise by setting &#963 to a value>0.</p>

We define \(e_1\) and \(e_2\)  as signals of length <i>n</i> with distributions:
<ul>
  <li>\(e_1\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_1)\)</li>
  <li>\(e_2\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_2)\)</li>
</ul>

If you set "Noise type" to "white" the noise will be:
<ul>
  <li>\(E_1=e_1\)</li>
  <li>\(E_2=e_2\)</li>
</ul>

If you set "Noise type" to "red" the noise at a location \(x_i\) will be defined as resulting from an ARIMA model of order (1,0,0) with autoregressive coefficient set to \(\sigma/11\).

<h3>
Sub-signals characteristics:
</h3>
<p>
Each sub-signal is designed as a sinusoid with a certain period T, amplitude A, and phase &#934: \(f(x)=Acos(2\pi(\frac{x}{T}+\phi))\).
Breaks can be produced in the signals using x<sub>min</sub> and x<sub>max</sub>, so that:
<ul>
<li> If x \(\in [x_{min},x_{max}]\), \(y(x)=f(x)\)</li>
<li> If x \(\notin [x_{min},x_{max}]\), \(y(x)=0\)</li>
</ul>
Setting amplitude to 0 for some sub-signals results in their having no effect on the signal itself.
